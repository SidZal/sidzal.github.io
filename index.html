                        <tab></tab>I am a Mechanical Engineer, and I recently completed my Bachelor's and Master's degrees at UCLA. I have conducted research in robotics locomotion at the Structures-Computer Interaction Lab at UCLA and was the Lead Powertrain Engineer for Bruin Racing's SAE Supermileage Combustion Vehicle for the Shell Eco-Marathon in 2023. Since graduating, I have been expanding my skill set to become a better engineer, and I am currently seeking early career opportunities for mechanical or mechatronics engineering!

                        <tab></tab>I made this website to learn some web design and showcase my background. I am a motivated problem solver that thrives when prototyping and iterating on solutions to challenging engineering problems. You can see some of my projects in action on the <a class = "txt-link" href = "/portfolio/">portfolio</a> page. Through rigorous UCLA <a class = "txt-link" href = "/coursework/">coursework</a>, I have a strong understanding of mechanical fundamentals and a multidisciplinary approach to engineering, having completed my technical breadth in Computer Science. Feel free to connect with me on <a class = "txt-link" href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/sidzal/" target = "_blank" ref = "noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a> if you would like to chat!
