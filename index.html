                        <tab></tab>Hi! My name is Siddharth Zalavadia, and I am a Mechanical Engineer looking for early career opportunities. I recently completed my Master's and Bachelor's degrees at UCLA in Mechanical Engineering, and I am now eager to find my next engineering challenge. I am interested in automation, transportation, and energy.
                        <br><br>
                        <tab></tab>During my time in college, I developed numerous skills, in and outside of the classroom. I participated in Bruin Racing's SAE Supermileage club as Lead Powertrain Engineer for our Prototype Combustion Vehicle. I also did research on robotic locomotion with the Structures-Computer Interaction Lab. Through rigorous <a class = "txt-link" href = "/coursework/">coursework</a>, I also have a strong understanding of mechanical fundamentals and a multidisciplinary approach to engineering, having completed my technical breadth in Computer Science. I made this website to <a class = "txt-link" href = "/portfolio/">showcase</a> some of my work, so please look around!
