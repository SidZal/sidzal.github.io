                        <tab></tab>Hi! My name is Siddharth Zalavadia, and I am a Mechanical Engineer 
                        currently looking for internships or full-time positions. I recently completed
                        my Master's and Bachelor's degrees at UCLA in Mechanical Engineering, and I am
                        now eager to develop my career. I am interested in automation, energy, and
                        transportation engineering. In my free time, I like to tinker with PC building,
                        play guitar, and make 3D animations!
                        <br><br>
                        <tab></tab>During my time in college, I developed numerous skills, in and outside
                        of the classroom. I participated in Bruin Racing's 
                        SAE Supermileage club as Lead Powertrain Engineer for our Prototype Combustion Vehicle.
                        I also did research on robotic locomotion with the Structures-Computer Interaction Lab.
                        Through rigorous <a class = "txt-link" href = "/coursework/">coursework</a>, 
                        I have a strong mechanical background and multidisciplinary approach to engineering,
                        having completed my technical breadth in Computer Science.
                        I made this website to 
                        <a class = "txt-link" href = "/portfolio/">showcase</a> 
                        some of my work, so please look around!
