                    <tab></tab>Hi! My name is Siddharth Zalavadia, and I am a recent Master's graduate of Mechanical Engineering at UCLA. 
                    I graduated in June of 2025, completing my Bachelor's and Master's. 
                    I am currently looking for full-time engineering positions.
                    <br><br>
                    <tab></tab>At UCLA, I have developed an interest in robotics, controls, and electromechanical systems in general. 
                    I have designed, analyzed, and built robotic arms and locomotive
                    platforms for multiple applications, some of which I will be compiling and showcasing on this website.
