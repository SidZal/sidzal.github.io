                Hi! My name is Siddharth Zalavadia, and I am a Mechanical Engineer currently finishing concurrent Master's and Bachelor's degrees at UCLA. 
                I intend to graduate in June of 2025, and I am currently looking for full-time positions starting in late 2025 or 2026.
                <br><br>
                I am interested in applied mechanics and robotics, and I am currently working at the Structures-Computer Interaction Lab at UCLA, designing and implementing
                robotic platforms to assist in research, primarily around robotic locomotion.
                I also have experience with UCLA's Bruin Racing SAE Supermileage team, where I led the powertrain team for our prototype combustion vehicle.
                In this role, I coordinated a team of engineers to improve on our team's drivetrain to ensure it was as fuel-efficient as possible.
                <br><br>
                I made this website to showcase some of the projects I have worked in, particularly some of the robots I have designed and put together in my UCLA lab.
