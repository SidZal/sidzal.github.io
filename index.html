                Hi! My name is Siddharth Zalavadia, and I am a Mechanical Engineer currently finishing concurrent Master's and Bachelor's degrees at UCLA. 
                I intend to graduate in June of 2025, and I am currently looking for full-time engineering positions.
                <br><br>
                    At UCLA, I have developed an interest in robotics, controls, and electromechanical systems in general. I have designed, analyzed, and built robotic arms and locomotive
                platforms for multiple applications, some of which I will be compiling and showcasing on this website.
            </p>
