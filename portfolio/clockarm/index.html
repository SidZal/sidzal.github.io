                        <tab></tab> As part of the UCLA course MAE C263A, I worked on a group project focused on making a robotic system
                        to apply what we had learned in class given a kit that included several Dynamixel MX-28AR servo motors. Since the focus of the class was on
                        the kinematics of robotics, we opted to create a robot that did not need feedback or high-speeds to achieve its task. The robot shown here is
                        the final result: a 2R planar arm attached to a prismatic joint to move the planar links up and down, with the ability to write and erase on
                        the whiteboard with a pen attached to the end effector. We chose to demonstrate the robot by having it continuously write out
                        time in a 24-hour, hours and minutes format.
                        <br><br>
                        <tab></tab> I was largely responsible for programming the robot's operation. I abstracted the problem into
                        two primary classes: a low-level servos control class that provided simple, task-specific functions to work with the Dynamixel SDK library and
                        a kinematics class to compute inverse kinematics and plan trajectories. Another group member wrote code that helps trajectory planning by
                        providing arrays of coordinates for each number. In the demonstration below, you can see the robot updating the time from 1:09 pm (1309) to 1:10 pm (1310).
