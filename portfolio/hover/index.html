                    <tab></tab>A buoyancy engine is a device that is designed to control the buoyant force on a submerged object to propel it vertically through the fluid.
                    Buoyant force is equal to the product of fluid density, volume displaced, and gravity. 
                    Ignoring the effects of drag or friction, we can equate this force to weight to find that
                    a submerged object is in static equilibrium when its mass is equal to the fluid density times volume displaced. 
                    Typically, buoyancy engines include pressurized tanks of gas that inflate and deflate balloon-like limbs to control volume with constant mass, thus
                    controlling buoyant force.
                    <br><br>
                    <tab></tab>In this project, I was tasked with developing a rigid buoyancy engine for viscous fluids, 
                    as part of larger research surrounding robotic locomotion through viscous fluids.
                    A rigid body allows more control as the buoyant force on other engines may not be perfectly aligned against gravity as the balloon volume inflates in complex shapes.
                    We can achieve this rigidity with two threaded shells, rotated by a motor.
                    The image here shows the exploded view of the prototype in SOLIDWORKS, which is then 3D-printed
                    and early testing of the 3D-printed threads being motorized is also shown.
                    The motor is fixed to one shell as it rotates the other, increasing or decreasing the cylindrical body's height, and thus, its volume.

                    <tab></tab> Our working fluid was liquid glycerin, which has a density of about 1.26 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. It is not conductive, so we are not concerned with it getting near the electronics,
                    however the inside of the shells still required some sealing to ensure the volume does not fill up with the dense fluid and throw off the force balance.
                    Counter-weights were also placed inside the shell
                    to bring the force balance between gravity and buoyancy to near equilibrium, 
                    so changes in volume can allow for negative or positive forces in the vertical direction.
                    In this video, we can see the system operating with manual control. As I actuate the system to adjust the device's volume,
                    the buoyant force becomes stronger or weaker than gravity accordingly, resulting in upwards or downwards motion respectively.
